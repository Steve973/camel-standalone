# Apache Camel Standalone

## Introduction
This project allows a user to run Apache Camel as a standalone application without the need to develop
or manage a separate application to keep the context(s) running.  It provides a shell to interact with
the application, which provides the ability to add contexts, control them, and get status of the
contexts, including the routes that have been added to them.
